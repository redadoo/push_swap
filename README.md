## Objectives 
Writing a sorting algorithm is always a very important step in a developer’s journey. It
is often the first encounter with the concept of [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms).

Sorting algorithms and their complexity are part of the classic questions discussed
during job interviews. It’s probably a good time to look at these concepts since you’ll
have to face them at some point.

The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C, and use of basic algorithms.
Especially focusing on their complexity.

Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. Especially
because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting solution can
differ.

## About

The goal of push_swap is to write a sorting algorithm to sort a stack.

this project is part of the common core of 42.
